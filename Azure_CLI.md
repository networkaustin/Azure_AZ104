# Downloading Azure CLI

## Step 1: Install Azure CLI from Windows
The Azure CLI installer can be accessed from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli#install-or-update)

Choose either the 32-bit or 64-bit version, depending on your system. I chose the 64-bit. 

## Step 2: Run the installer
After you have downloaded the file, go to your downloads folder and click on the installer file. When the installer has finished, click 'Finish', then close and reopen any open CLI windows.
